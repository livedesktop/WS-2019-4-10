In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race.

How? You blow at them with more bubbles, and when three or more of the same color come together, they all explode. Just tap at where you want the next bubble to go.\r\nThe more bubbles blow up at one tap, the increasingly more points you gain (six ones at one tap is better tan two three-bubble taps). Besides, those bubbles that fell apart from the rest will explode too. It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror. This feature becomes really handful when the center of your board is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.\r\nIf your tap fails to detonate any bubbles, you get a foul, and when there are several fouls, one or two new line of bubbles appears at the top. The number of misfires allowed before bubbles will advance again, is shown by the number of silver ball in the left bottom corner.\r\nThe game is over when you clean all the bubbles off and your score doubles, or bubbles move all the way down on you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH682R4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Papa Pear Saga","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17482.13510798886650137.a373f6c3-c521-49c5-84cc-7c8603eae67e.0915c005-d5bb-424e-87d1-2086133b81a8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11336.13510798886650137.e2ed6ef1-aa37-4e6b-a25a-d19c18ee96ee.9f0e6b8c-2cb1-4ed9-a4ed-794ad72f13e7","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38351.13510798886650137.8b80a25c-7c76-474d-bdbd-ab24b644e271.e2bdcf2e-ccdb-4f64-8a00-34b624c64f36","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11900.13510798886650137.3819eaaf-4061-4a4c-9494-9e3f6a82852c.ed1f79c3-418d-425a-9983-1b32dbc38a21","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6676.13510798886650137.073254bd-8523-4cca-a4bd-f2cab382d98f.238198de-060a-44c8-93b1-7f0f1c4d6078","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58454.13510798886650137.85543917-c8ba-4599-9be8-e0e8bf40d31d.60ae7199-ba0a-4f66-94d7-073be6b76328","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50210.13510798886650137.0a6f6283-bc8b-41a2-8069-ea5d680ff367.20835167-ab27-422c-a305-735fe1eb3f90","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36050.13510798886650137.60a0b2ab-314a-4142-9c1d-d237f7931a2e.f5124b2b-7c96-49d6-9226-93648d4c9b91","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37402.13510798886650137.8d9fc630-40e3-433f-8545-386166510afe.27ee430d-6957-426d-9b39-b050f61703b3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["king.com.PapaPearSaga_kgqvnymyfvs32"],"ContentIds":["f3c99646-409d-d7a3-1297-54575c4b429b","0e041ca6-0804-2718-d7a9-0ba4c2db30b9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Papa Pear Saga, from the makers of Candy Crush Saga & Farm Heroes Saga!\r\n\r\nIt's a Papa Fiesta!

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

legions of enemies attack from all sides. The powerful domain of the kingdom attracts enemies of all kinds, each more dangerous and devastating to the realm's armies than the last. \r\n\r\nThe king's reign has been threatened, and his personal sorcerer believes he has come up with a way to pull on ancient magic to ensure protection of castle and king, but something terrible and unexpected occurred during the spell and now a dark and mysterious force now looms large over the lands. It is only a matter of time before the day of reckoning descends over the nations and heralds the realms to a new age and dominate empire. \r\n\r\nCenturies of Feuding...\r\nThey'd inherited the feud from their fathers and couldn't recall the original cause. Perhaps they knew not who started it or why, but they certainly knew who would end it and how. Blinking up at the glaring light, the dark centers of the warrior's blazing eyes seemed to sear the air around the fierce brute. The magician stood back- pleased, yet on edge at what to expect. The spell was complete. The Druid Warlord of legend was born, and he was ready to go to war for the people of Komkaria. The Warlord lurched upright, and the glint of a candlelight flashed off his blade as it swung viciously through the air. \"Traitor!\" the Warlord growled. As the blade found its mark, and the blood gurgled up in the throat of the magician, he realized the one fatal flaw in his spell...\r\n\r\nGive it Your Best Shot...\r\nFight your way against dozens of ultimate foes as you guard the mighty powers of this impressive temple of war. The forceful soul of the guardian spirit is potent within these walls, but whose side does he champion? Wield magic weapons and powers as you confront the terror of the lands and conquer the people's greatest fears from legends lost.\r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\n\r\n*Discover epic pixel weapons \r\n*Search the temples for amazing perks \r\n*Fight barbarians hand-to-hand \r\n*Real-time map with sky view alerts \r\n*Increasingly difficult survival challenge\r\n*Navigate three intense FPS terrains","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH0816W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Red Hands - 2-Player Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36339.13510798882845652.1da639a8-2e43-4ee8-91b1-01859a1475b8.37179797-f9ff-49a9-a1ef-c4105ea2d2be","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5359.13510798882845652.a6726121-6d85-425b-8dc7-69479d1f7355.c4fa15b6-2594-4b8a-a509-f1db9f9ea241","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39622.13510798882845652.17d9e4d4-edd6-49e8-8bce-36c3c20fe22d.4e0cca48-6b3d-47d6-a654-025ee0348099","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["Peaksel.RedHands-2-PlayerGames_tyntx30xb5zhp"],"ContentIds":["2447c519-5f5a-c7e0-f5e7-4ced45c51ce8","b3b7a325-c906-6cf4-0f6a-d2c857c36bde"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Red Hands – 2-Player Games is based on a game for kids known as “hot hands”, “slaps” or even in some countries “slap jack”.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King. \r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MXX63VPD7QR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pacman 2 Endless Maze Offline Game Free Download","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35683.13881457145339344.8eaf6ca7-049f-49e9-a232-b9ac69605fa2.9db99d0d-ccd8-4389-8344-c686f3436ad5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37341.13881457145339344.8eaf6ca7-049f-49e9-a232-b9ac69605fa2.4082f5af-98c1-4d4e-9870-42781b1467b1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19223.13881457145339344.8eaf6ca7-049f-49e9-a232-b9ac69605fa2.c2fcc86e-7618-4cb1-8367-f2656ffd087f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38522.13881457145339344.8eaf6ca7-049f-49e9-a232-b9ac69605fa2.520b6068-c643-44cc-96bd-f0f7c22f5ef4","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32441AmilaJayathissa.Pacman2EndlessMazeOfflineGame_2jgec4z81wfr8"],"ContentIds":["4e4fa258-ef3f-9f0c-6b54-294e3c1c411f","6b28c1f3-de2c-43e3-55b3-e8b1cac90732"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pacman 2 Endless Maze Offline Game Free\r\n\r\nMore ->> https://www.amilajayathissa.com <<--\r\n\r\nThis Pacman 2 game is awesome game with advanced maze. you can play it also offline.

features inside bets, outside bets, call bets, special bets, and favorite bets.\r\n- The roulette wheel has 37 slots numbered 0-36. The objective of the game is to predict which slot the ball will land in after the wheel is spun.\r\n- The minimum and maximum bets for the game are displayed on the MIN/MAX section of the table.\r\n- Payouts are made according to the Paytable. To view the Paytable, click the i-button in the keypad, alternatively see the Payout section below.\r\n\r\nHow to Play\r\n\r\nSelect a chip value, place your bets, spin the wheel, and wait to see if you have correctly predicted the winning number.\r\n\r\n- Selecting a chip value. To select the desired chip value, click a chip in the keypad area. If there are active arrows to the left and right of the chips, click these to see additional chip values.\r\n- You can point at different positions of the table to highlight the bets. When a bet position is highlighted, a window appears and displays the minimum and maximum bet limits for that bet.\r\n- Placing one or several bets. To place a bet, select the chip value and click either a number or a betting position on the table. Additional clicks add the required number of chips of the same value to the selected bet area.\r\n- After a bet is placed, you can point at the chips on the table to view the total value of the bet and the total payout if the bet wins.\r\n- Spinning the wheel. When you have finished betting, click the spin button to start a game round. The ball is then launched into the roulette wheel. The amount you bet is deducted from your account. The ball lands in a slot and the number on the slot is the winning number.\r\n- A player can stop the roulette wheel anytime while it is spinning, by clicking the spin button. This function is not available during Autoplay (not available in all casinos).\r\n- It is possible to spin the wheel without placing any bets (not available in all casinos).  \r\n- Checking the winning number. When the ball lands in a slot, the winning number is announced and all winning bets are paid. The winning number is displayed on the roulette wheel. Your winnings are also displayed in the game panel and are added to your Cash amount. All losing bets are cleared from the table.\r\n- Playing again. Click the rebet button to place the same bet as in the previous round. Alternatively, click the clear all bets button to clear the table of all previous bets, place any new bets, and then click the spin button.\r\n\r\nAuto Adjust Bet\r\n\r\n- If a bet exceeds the bet limit or table limit, or if the player is out of money, the Auto Adjust Bet function automatically adjusts the bet to the highest possible amount. If the bet consists of several bet positions, it will be scaled down proportionally over the included bet positions. If the scaled down bet is too small to cover all desired bet positions, chips will be placed on as many of these positions as possible. If all desired bet positions cannot be covered, the game will randomly choose which positions should receive chips.\r\n- To activate this function, open the Game settings menu.\r\n\r\nSpecial Bets Panel\r\n\r\n- Special bets are types of call bets and are made by placing chips directly on the name of the bet in the Special bets panel. To open the Special bets panel, click the Favorite bets button.\r\n- When this panel is open, it lists all special bets available.\r\n- When you move your mouse over a special bet, the game highlights the bet numbers on the table.\r\n- To scroll through the pages of the special bets list, use the arrows at the bottom of the panel.\r\n\t\r\nFavourite Bets\r\n\r\n- The game has a favorite bets feature, which allows you to save bets of any configuration and place them automatically.
