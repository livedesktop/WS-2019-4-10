So feed the whale by attacking the targets and make sure you stay out of the range of hunters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngry whale needs food to survive and you have multiple missions that include attacking people on the beach and animals in the sea. The killer whale is out on the hunt. Use the on screen navigation controls to swim in water and reach the target. Happy hunting\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the Angry Whale Simulator 2016 game.

It is one of the best known board games of all-time.\r\n\r\nThe classic fast-trading property game features tokens from the 1930s all the way to the 2000s, with a beautiful game board and cards, the game takes you back to when it all began, but you still have to build your houses and hotels and see if you can bankrupt everyone else. The jet-set gameplay will be epic as you race around the world to visit the world’s most exciting places and buy locations.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is also known popularly called Business Board Game, The Landlord's Game and Finance\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a great game for 2 - 6 players. It is a board game where players roll two six-sided dice to move around the game board, buying and trading properties, and develop them with houses and hotels. Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money. The way you win in Monopoly is by collecting rents on property, or cash flow.\r\n\r\nOnopoly brilliantly combines both strategy and chance. It gets stressful and exciting, especially when things get closer to the endgame. \r\n\r\nYou better keep an eye on your money, because you never know when the dice will land you with a massive rent bill to pay. Sometimes staying in jail can be the safest place to be, but only after your properties are primed to make you money.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got to buy, sell and negotiate to win.

The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model.

They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \r\n\r\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them *** \r\n\r\nSliding your finger any where on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part - sliding finger there moves the left control stick. \r\n\r\nWe suggest to select beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P0B77B17XSK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Puzzles for Kids \"Funny Animals\", baby learning games for toddlers and free games for kids, puzzles, jigsaw.

Each turn, you need to add all ends of the board, and count the number of pips on them. If it is a multiple of five, you score those points.

Now she needs to find a way back home - and also save her planet.\r\n\r\nTRY THE FREE TRIAL VERSION, AND THEN UNLOCK THE COMPLETE ADVENTURE IN THE GAME!\r\n \r\nIt was late evening and the museum was almost empty. At the Maya artifact exhibition, one of the exhibits suddenly started to move. The sound drew the attention of a young woman named Diana, a museum employee and an expert in Mayan culture. When she came closer to the artifact she realized it looked like a portal... and suddenly some unknown power lifted her up and teleported her to an ancient temple! Now Diana has to figure out where she is, how she got there and how she's going to return home. The young woman encounters a civilization similar to the Mayan culture, but this is neither the past nor a parallel reality. It's another planet, connected to Earth centuries ago by some special gates. And now the gates have been activated again...\r\n\r\nOnly Shaash, the local shaman and gate keeper, can help Diana return home. But that will not be easy.

The deep snow in the winters has made it difficult for people to move around and tourists are also planning skiing trips and you have to transport the passengers and ski gear to offroad deep snow mountain tracks. Drive the snow tourist bus and pick n drop the passengers. You also have to pick the tourists from snowy hill resorts to city. Deep snow has made it very difficult & dangerous to drive on the narrow roads of the city and off road tracks have become even more risky. Make sure you don't hit the traffic and people on the road as it is really cold due to snow blizzards and the roads have become narrower. Snowy Bus Drive is a challenging game testing driving skills in risky and dangerous conditions and difficult paths. Hill drivers are really experts in cutting those hilly corners and curves but snow adds to the risk and challenge. Tourists in the mountain top resorts are depending for their survival on you so that they can reach the city safe and sound. Be the best snow bus driver on city and off-road conditions.\r\n\r\nUse the controls to accelerate and brake according to the conditions. Drive carefully and make sure you can see your way in the snow and control the bus on the skiddy ice. It is like a thin sheet of glass on the roads. Everything is covered in snow from the hill tops & mountain to roads to houses to hotels. The met department has reported that the snow storm is likely to keep at this pace for many days to come and people cannot use their cars to travel in this weather. Since you are one of the only few bus drivers providing the transport services in these tough hilly conditions on off-road and city roads, you have to be fast and rush to your destination to pick as many passengers as possible. People are depending upon you to reach their homes for Christmas and New Year. You are an expert snow driver who can make all this happen.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple game play missions in hilly off road conditions to complete so be ready for the kicks and excitement. Just launch into the game and drive away and you have to make sure you are driving safe. You will experience both city and off-road environment and view many scenic views of mountains and hills while you are driving in the snowy conditions. Drive the extreme snow bus drive away!\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the game.
